EVM-SDK-1 consumer B (independent of `Examples.Evm.TwoStepCounter`): an owner-granted credit
ledger. Reuses the same `Access` ownership gates, `Pausable` policy, and fixed single-pending
`Access.Ownership` value, plus one typed hashed-map namespace for per-account credits.

State: stored `owner` (rotated by two-step transfer), explicit `paused` flag, `UInt256` `total` of
claimed credits, and one fixed pending owner. `credits` uses namespace 0 of `AddressMap256`, the map
shape whose get/condition/put binding `Examples.Evm.Token` already proves end to end. Application
policy and typed State writes stay in this file; reusable balance debit mechanics live in
`Sdk.Fungible`.
