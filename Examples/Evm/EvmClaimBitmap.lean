R5-015 consumer B: permissionless one-time claims over the `Evm.Sdk.StorageBitmap` persistent
bitmap policy (capacity 130 bits = 3 words, so the word table has a *partial* final word: bits
128 and 129 are live in word 2, and bit 130 is the first OOB index — an index that would alias
bit 2 of word 2 through `index % 64` if the `inRange` gate did not fail closed).

This consumer's policy is deliberately different from `Examples.Evm.EvmFeatureFlags`: there is no
owner at all, claims are one-time (a replay reverts with the typed `already()` error instead of
an idempotent write), there is no clear/toggle, and the constructor is parameterless-state
(seeded like `EvmOrderedStorage`). `declared` threads the `Storage.Static` cursor in the exact
declaration order of `State`; every entry reads and writes state through ordinary typed `State`
field/`Vector` accesses and each physical write is a visible literal update of exactly one word
slot. `Tests/EvmBitmapSpec` proves the extracted slots and the `claimed` vector entry equal the
declared layout, and `runtime-tests/evm/anvil_bitmap_claims.sh` covers claim replay, the 63/64
word boundary, the final in-range bit 129, OOB aliasing probes, and state persistence across
reverts.

Enumeration, counting, and clear-all over the bitmap are intentionally absent: they would need
a `wordCount`-bounded loop, which this SDK policy does not provide and this consumer does not
fake.
