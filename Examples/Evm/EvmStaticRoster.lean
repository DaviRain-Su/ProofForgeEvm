EVM-SDK-2 consumer B: address/bool scalars plus a fixed array of records, plus the EVM-SDK-3
bounded static writer role set (two explicit address fields after the `closed` flag).

`declared` threads the `Storage.Static` cursor in the exact declaration order of `State`;
the handles are compile-time descriptor data erased before extraction, and every entry below
reads and writes state through ordinary typed `State` field/`Vector` accesses (including the
existing dynamic-index vector path for `seats`). Writer role decisions rebuild a
`Roles.Set2` value from the two explicit fields and every role write is a literal-slot field
update. `Tests/EvmStaticStorageSpec` proves the extracted slots and the `seats` vector entry
equal the declared layout; `Tests/EvmRolesSpec` pins the writer role slots and terminals.
