Reusable EVM access-policy combinators (EVM-SDK-1).

This module owns contract *policy gates*, not storage geometry. Every combinator is
`@[pf_inline]` and erases at extraction into the existing target-owned components:

- gates read `Context.caller` and compare through `Address.eq` (the `WideWord`
  component query), or delegate an explicit `UInt8` paused flag to `Sdk.Pausable`;
  construction-time immutable owners keep using the existing `Address.eqImmutable` directly
  (e.g. `Examples.Evm.Token`),
- failure terminals are the closed `Revert` set (`Unauthorized(caller)`, `Paused()`),
  never new error selectors;
- two-step ownership is one fixed `Ownership` value containing the sole pending address; the
  consumer stores that value as ordinary static state, so an accepted transfer cannot leave an
  older nominee live in another map entry.

Storage writes stay explicit: `Ownership.nominate` / `cancel` / `consume` return replacement
values, while the consumer's state transition writes both ownership policy and owner/paused
fields. This module never performs a hidden storage write.

Resource contract: gates are O(1) component queries; `Ownership` is exactly one `Address` (three
EVM words in the current address representation). There is no loop, allocation, hashed namespace,
or hidden storage.

Component boundary (intentionally absent here):

- no reentrancy guard: a sound guard needs a typed external-call/effect-sequencing contract, and
  the current closed-call set must not be pretended pure;
- no roles or pause-state owner: use `Sdk.Roles.Set2` for bounded role decisions and
  `Sdk.Pausable` for explicit pause flags/transitions;
- no new revert errors: only the existing closed `Revert` set is composed.

The public `ProofForge.Evm.Sdk` umbrella exports this component. Nothing in this module requires
`Evm.Golden`, `Evm.Registry`, Ops, IR, or Emit changes.
