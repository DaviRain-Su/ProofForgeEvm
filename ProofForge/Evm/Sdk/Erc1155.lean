# EVM SDK bounded ERC-1155 core (EVM-SDK-8)

Reusable O(1) single-id balance and operator core over the existing typed hashed-map namespaces.
A `(owner, tokenId)` balance lives in one `Storage.AddressPairMap256` keyed by the owner address
and the three-limb `tokenKey`; operator approval lives in one `Storage.AddressPairMap` UInt64
flag map. Both handles are compile-time `Storage.Layout` allocations; no runtime layout object,
heap allocation, or host Map/Array ever reaches contract state.

## Key envelope (honest bound)

`AddressPairMap256` keys are `Address` pairs, so a token id is accepted only when its top UInt256
limb is zero (`canEncode`): the supported id space is 192-bit. Every authorization and mutation
predicate gates on `canEncode` *before* `tokenKey` truncation, and consumers gate every view the
same way through the checked `balanceOf` helper. `id + 2^192` can never alias a live `(owner, id)`
balance through a view, authorization, or write.

## Owned surface

Single-id checked balance reads, `setApprovalForAll`/`isApprovedForAll`, checked mint/credit,
checked burn/debit, and alias-safe `transfer` decisions/effects (equal source/destination is a
successful no-op after the debit gate instead of two writes through the same hashed key). Credit
rejects UInt256 wraparound; debit rejects underflow.

## Explicitly unsupported

Batch operations (`safeBatchTransferFrom`, `balanceOfBatch`, mint/burn batches), ERC1155Receiver
callbacks (`onERC1155Received`), metadata URI, standard typed `TransferSingle`/`TransferBatch`/
`ApprovalForAll` events, and unbounded inputs. There is no new Runtime leaf, hashed-map kind,
Op/IR/Component/Emit recipe, protocol opcode, selector/topic/offset magic, or hidden storage
write: every state write is an existing explicit hashed-map effect. Authorization against
`Context.caller`, event/error ordering, pause, and supply policy remain application-owned.
