# EVM SDK persistent bounded storage ring queue of UInt64 (circular buffer)

`StorageRing` is the reusable *persistent* fixed-capacity circular-buffer policy for EVM static
storage (an ordinary Solidity-style head/length/payload triple, like OpenZeppelin's `Queue`
semantics). It binds the shared `Core.Collections.BoundedQueue` fixed-frame FIFO semantics to
the existing physical state model — exactly the way `StorageVec` binds `Core.Value.BoundedVec`
and `StorageBitmap` binds `Core.Collections.BoundedBitSet`:

- **compile-time capacity**: the backing store is an ordinary `Vector UInt64 capacity` field of
  the consumer's `State` structure, flattened by the existing fixed-vector extraction path into
  `capacity` consecutive static slots (`values_0 … values_<capacity-1>`). There is no runtime
  slot allocator, no hashed namespace, and no pointer; the slot table is fixed at extraction.
- **disjoint metadata slots**: one slot holds the physical index of the front element (`head`)
  and one disjoint slot holds the live element count (`length`). They are separate scalar
  fields declared *after* the backing slots, so head, length, and payload never alias.
- **checked ring semantics**: the pure `pf_inline` decisions below own all
  head/length/slot/index policy (`wellFormed`/`isEmpty`/`isFull`/`canPeek`/`canGet`/
  `canPop`/`canPush`/`canClear`); inactive backing slots are never reachable through an
  admissible decision. Wraparound is `mod`-ulo the fixed positive capacity: `absIndex head
  offset capacity = (head + offset) % capacity`, the same arithmetic as
  `Core.Collections.BoundedQueue` (`capacity < UInt32.size`, so host `UInt64` and EVM `mod`
  agree exactly on every reachable value).

## Why decisions, not returned queues

The current EVM extraction lowers dynamic-index `Vector` reads/writes only when the vector is a
`State` field and the index proof is an explicit `if h : … < capacity` hypothesis in the consumer
(`Examples.Evm.EvmStaticRoster.setSeat`, `Examples.Evm.EvmVecLog.record`). A generic helper returning an
updated queue value is not an extractable shape today, so — exactly like `StorageVec` and
`Roles.Set2` — this module owns the reusable *decisions and slot arithmetic* while applications
own the literal `State` field writes:

```lean
if StorageRing.canPush capacity s.head s.live then
  let tail := StorageRing.absIndex s.head s.live capacity
  if h : tail.toNat < capacity then       -- compiler proof for the physical write
    let next := s.live + 1
    .ok ({ s with values := s.values.set tail.toNat value h, live := next }, …)
  else
    .error .malformed                     -- unreachable under an admissible decision
else
  .ok (s, Revert.capExceeded)
```

The inner `else` is unreachable whenever the SDK decision drives the branch; mapping it to the
application's malformed terminal keeps the write path honest without duplicating policy.

## Physical-state contract

- `values`: a fixed payload table of `capacity` slots; inactive slots are unreachable and may
  retain stale values.
- `head`: the physical slot index (`0.<capacity-1>`) of the front element. While the queue is
  empty, head is the canonical `0` — the same normalization `Core.Collections.BoundedQueue.pop?`
  and `clear` perform — so an emptied queue never carries a masked non-canonical head.
- `live`: the live element count `0..capacity`, always `≤ capacity`.

One word on the semantic binding: `Core.Collections.BoundedQueue.wellFormed` makes the
canonical-empty case (`head = 0` while `length = 0`) part of its invariant and this SDK enforces
exactly that, so host truth tables over `BoundedQueue` are the real policy semantics and every
emitted `mod`/`add`/`sub` is truthful on extraction.

## Fail-closed policy

| situation | decision result | suggested consumer terminal |
|---|---|---|
| `capacity <= head` (malformed head) | every decision is `false` | typed malformed error before any store |
| `head ≠ 0` while `live = 0` (non-canonical empty) | every decision is `false` | typed malformed error before any store |
| `capacity < live` (malformed live count) | every decision is `false` | typed malformed error before any store |
| enqueue when `live = capacity` (full) | `canPush = false` | `CapExceeded()` |
| dequeue/peek when `live = 0` (empty) | `canPop`/`canPeek = false` | typed error / revert before any store |
| get with `live ≤ offset` (OOB) | `canGet = false` | view fallback or typed error |
| clear with canonical state | `canClear = true` | resets only `head`/`live` |
| any mutation with malformed state | decision is `false` | typed malformed error before any store |

`clear` deliberately does not rewrite backing slots: they stay stale and unreachable, matching
`Core.Collections.BoundedQueue.clear`. Zeroing them is an application gas decision, not a
correctness requirement.

## Preflight / no-partial-update ordering

Every mutation is a *decision first, physical writes second*: `canPeek`/`canPop`/`canPush`/
`canClear` is evaluated over the loaded `head`/`live` scalars before any segment of the
consumer's update is bound, and a rejected (or malformed) decision returns without touching any
slot. Under ProofForge's ordered storage semantics a rejected operation therefore stores
neither metadata nor payload — there is no partial head/length/payload update.

## Resource contract (worst case, O(1) in every dimension)

Each operation touches a constant number of *distinct* storage slots, independent of
`capacity`; there is no loop over the backing array. Distinct-slot footprint:

| operation | distinct slots read | slots written | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `canGet` read (view) | 3 | 0 | `head`/`live` + selected element slot |
| enqueue | 2 | 2 | gate reads `head`/`live`; stores `values[absIndex head live]` + `live` |
| dequeue | 3 | 2 | reads `head`/`live` + `values[head]`; stores `head` + `live` |
| peek (view) | 3 | 0 | reads `head`/`live` + `values[head]` |
| clear | 2 | 2 | validates, then stores `head` and `live` only |

Two honest qualifiers: (1) the ring slot expressions (`absIndex`, `poppedHead`) are recomputed
at each use site instead of cached in a Yul local — a constant number of `add`/`mod` ops, and
the solc optimizer may CSE them; (2) a consumer's own authorization gate adds its own footprint
(e.g. `Access.requireOwner` reads the three Address limbs of the stored owner). Cold
zero→nonzero SSTORE pricing dominates real gas; the SDK guarantees only the *shape* — constant,
capacity-independent slot count, no iteration. The descriptor is compile-time data erased
before extraction and costs nothing at runtime.

/-! ## Runtime policy decisions

All decisions are pure `pf_inline` functions over the explicit `head`/`live` scalars and the
compile-time `capacity` scalar. `capacity` must decode to a compile-time literal at every call
site (consumers expose one `@[pf_inline]` capacity literal for it); only
`head`/`live`/`offset` are runtime values. Every decision rechecks `wellFormed`, so malformed
persisted head/length fails closed even if storage was corrupted outside the component. -/

/-- Persisted metadata is canonical: `head < capacity`, `live ≤ capacity`, and an empty queue
carries the canonical head `0`. Any corrupted over-capacity head/live pair fails closed. -/
@[pf_inline] def wellFormed (capacity head live : UInt64) : Bool :=
  0 < capacity && live ≤ capacity && (if live == 0 then head == 0 else head < capacity)

wraparound modulo the fixed positive capacity as `Core.Collections.BoundedQueue`. Meaningful

backing slot `absIndex head live capacity` and stores `live + 1`; head is unchanged. -/
@[pf_inline] def canPush (capacity head live : UInt64) : Bool :=
  wellFormed capacity head live && !isFull capacity live

stores `poppedHead head live capacity` and `live - 1`; the popped slot keeps its stale value
and stays unreachable. -/
